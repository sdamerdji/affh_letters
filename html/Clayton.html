    Dear Clayton City Council:
    
    We are writing on behalf of <b class="text-bold">YIMBY Law</b> regarding Clayton’s 6th Cycle Housing 
    Element Update. 
    <b class="text-bold">YIMBY Law</b> is a legal nonprofit working to make housing 
    in California more accessible and affordable through enforcement of state law.
    
    We are writing to remind you of Clayton's legal duty to affirmatively further fair housing, which requires 'taking
    meaningful actions... that overcome patterns of segregation" §8899.50(a)(1). The City of Clayton is wealthier than
    the average Bay Area city and has been identified by researchers as being segregated from other cities. 
    
    An average home in Clayton costs 1470304.0, which is only affordable to someone earning a salary of 
    717445.086968889.
     This means your city is only affordable to Americans in the top 1%.
        <br>
        
        Thank you,
