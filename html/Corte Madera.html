    Dear Corte Madera City Council:
    
    We are writing on behalf of <b class="text-bold">YIMBY Law</b> regarding Corte Madera’s 6th Cycle Housing 
    Element Update. 
    <b class="text-bold">YIMBY Law</b> is a legal nonprofit working to make housing 
    in California more accessible and affordable through enforcement of state law.
    
    We are writing to remind you of Corte Madera's legal duty to affirmatively further fair housing, which requires 'taking
    meaningful actions... that overcome patterns of segregation" §8899.50(a)(1). The City of Corte Madera is wealthier than
    the average Bay Area city and has been identified by researchers as being segregated from other cities. 
    
    An average home in Corte Madera costs 2034674.0, which is only affordable to someone earning a salary of 
    990830.931591111.
     This means your city is only affordable to Americans in the top 1%. In fact, there are many castles in the France that cost less than an average home in your city.
        <br>
        
        Thank you,
