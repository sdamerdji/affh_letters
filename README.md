Automated letter campaign for Bay Area cities with high degrees of segregation

# Data sources

Berkeley's OBI data is available at the bottom of this page: https://belonging.berkeley.edu/racial-segregation-san-francisco-bay-area-part-1

Home price data comes from Zillow: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/
I use Zillow Home Value Index for all homes (seasonally adjusted)

Berkeley's OBI dataset excludes a few cities (e.g. Belvedere and Woodside), so for those cities I use 2019 ACS data (race.csv, income.csv)
